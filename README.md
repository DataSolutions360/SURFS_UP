# SURFS_UP

## Overview ##
The purpose of this analysis was to find out more information about the 
temperature data, specifically JUNE(summer) and DECEMBER(winter) months, both
are on and off-season on purpose.  This information will be used to determine 
if the SURF AND ICE CREAM SHOP business is sustainable year round.

Observations:
    
- The temperatures were not as hot as expected.  Even though it is in Hawaii and close to the equator, 
my conjecture is that the Pacific Ocean does in fact cool the land surrounded by and adjacent to it.
    
- The temperatures of June were relatively close to the temperatures of one another, leading me to 
believe that the data was quite reliable as a sample for a given month/season.  
I then applied the same logic to December in Deliverable 2.   
    
### Deliverable 2 ###

  Summary statustics for the Month of December in Oahu:

  Observations:
  
  - The temperatures were indeed consistent within the sample of December data.  With 
  the average temperature expected to be lower(71 degrees F), it is safe to say that the 
  dependability of temperatures does have significance in the analsysis.  with a standard
  deviation of only 3.75 degrees.
  
  ## Summary ##
  
  With both samples(June and December) running consistant(low varying) temperatures, it is
  a wise decisionj to move forward with the amount of business the show will have, with
  respect to the precipitation.  
  
  Like with any seasonal business, it is expected to slow down during less warm times. 
  This can be forecasted accurately, to "Weather the Storm" of fiscally challenging times.
